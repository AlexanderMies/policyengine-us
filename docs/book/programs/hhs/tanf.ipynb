    "# Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently in development, TANF is a state-level benefit program.\n",
    "\n",
    "From benefits.gov:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program provides grant funds to states and territories to provide families with financial assistance and related support services. State-administered programs may include childcare assistance, job preparation, and work assistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## General formula\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate TANF entitlement, we use the general computation tree below (may vary depending on state and county):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `tanf`: TANF entitlement\n",
    "  - `tanf_amount_if_eligible`: amount if eligible\n",
    "    - Definition: `tanf_max_amount - tanf_countable_income`\n",
    "    - `tanf_max_amount`: maximum amount\n",
    "      - **Parameters**: the maximum amount defined by different state TANF programs may vary due to these factors:\n",
    "        - Household size: How many people live in the household.\n",
    "        - \"Region\": Some states may define a \"region\"-level distinction for maximum amounts; for example, California (CalWORKS) defines two regions based on what county the household resides in.\n",
    "        - Individual household properties such as caregiver or disability status.\n",
    "        - Example: California (CalWORKS) has different maximum amounts based on these factors, which they define as \"exempt/non-exempt\".\n",
    "        - State-specific policies.\n",
    "    - `tanf_countable_income`: Amount deducted from TANF maximum amount based on income.\n",
    "      - `tanf_gross_earned_income`: earned income.\n",
    "        - **Parameter**: list of earned income sources summed.\n",
    "      - `tanf_gross_unearned_income`: unearned income. (ADD DEF HERE)\n",
    "        - **Parameter**: list of unearned income sources summed.\n",
    "      - `deductions`: deductions from assessed income.\n",
    "        - `earnings_deduction`: deduction amount based on earnings.\n",
    "          - **Parameter**: percentage of earnings deducted from gross earned income.\n",
    "          - **Parameter**: flat amount deducted from the household's gross earned income.\n",
    "          - **Parameter**: flat amount deducted from each earner's gross earned income.\n",
    "  - `is_tanf_eligible`: whether eligible for TANF\n",
    "    - `is_tanf_enrolled`: whether a family is already enrolled in TANF.\n",
    "    - `is_tanf_demographically_eligible`: demographic definition of TANF eligibility, which is mostly constant across the US.\n",
    "      - Definition: If there are children (ages 0-17) present in the household, pregnant people, or there are people aged 18 years old that are currently enrolled in a school, the family is demographically eligible for TANF.\n",
    "    - `is_tanf_economically_eligible`: Whether the family has sufficiently low income to qualify for eligibility.\n",
    "      - `is_tanf_enrolled`: whether a family is already enrolled in TANF.\n",
    "      - `is_tanf_continuous_eligible`:\n",
    "        - `tanf_eligibility_income`: income measure used to assess eligibility for TANF.\n",
    "          - **Parameters**: income definition varies depending on state policies:\n",
    "            - **Parameter**: deductions from income per earner\n",
    "            - **Parameter**: deductions from income per household\n",
    "        - `tanf_max_amount` (defined above)\n",
    "      - `is_tanf_initial_eligible`:\n",
    "        - This variable is very similar to `is_continuous_eligible`, except for the initial employment deductions that are applied to determininig initial eligibility.\n",
