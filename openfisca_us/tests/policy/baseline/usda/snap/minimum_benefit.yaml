#notes:
#1868 is max gross income eligibility for 2.
#if we assume all income is earned income, 
#the standard and earnings deduction
#are sufficient to satisfy max net income 
#eligibility.
#for simplicity, we are also assuming that there
#is no housing cost over 50% of:
# (snap_gross_income) - 
# (earnings_deductions+standard_deduction)

#following through the calculation, you eventually get 
#snap_max_benefit[2] - expected_contribution_towards_food
# = 374 - 398.22 = -24.22
#however, given that this household meets the income eligibility standards
#and does not exceed the household size of 2, they are entitled to the 
#max benefit of 16 dollars (not calculated from our benefit amount, but
#rather cited from:

#following through this example would give you a 
#benefit of 20.38 per month. There is 
#no minimum benefit for housholds over 2. 

#this assumes all income is earned income -
#if this were not the case it seems this 
#family would have a negative benefit amount,
#and have de facto no eligibility
