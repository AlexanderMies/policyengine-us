#notes:
#1868 is max gross income eligibility. if we assume all income
#is earned income, the standard and earnings deduction
#are sufficient to satisfy max net income eligibility.
#for simplicity, we are also assuming that there is no housing 
#cost over 50% of (snap_gross_income-(earnings_deductions+standard_deduction))

#following through the calculation, you eventually get 
#snap_max_benefit[2] - expected_contribution_towards_food
# = 374 - 398.22 = -24.22
#however, given that this household meets the income eligibility standards
#and does not exceed the household size of 2, they are entitled to the 
#max benefit of 16 dollars (not calculated from our benefit amount, but
#rather cited from:
